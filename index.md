<h2 class="no-display">Introduction</h2>

*Accessibility, usability, and inclusion* are closely related and overlap significantly. They are most effectively addressed together, such as when designing and developing websites and applications. While practitioners should understand that each aspect may have somewhat different requirements and standards, a holistic approach leads to a more accessible, usable, and inclusive web for everyone.

## Inclusive Design

In some regions this is referred to as *universal design* or *design for all*. It involves designing products, such as websites, to allow their use by the broadest audience possible. This includes people with different needs and preferences, which may be due to disability or other circumstance. For example, one person may need text size larger or smaller than another, or may prefer a specific font type over another. Fortunately the Web is designed to be adaptable so that it can meet these different needs, for example through web browser and website preference settings.

Accessibility addresses many aspects of inclusive design on the Web, which is why it is sometimes considered to be a synonym. However, accessibility alone does not address all aspects of inclusive web design, such as for language support and mobile design. Also, such a broad focus would likely overshadow specific accessibility requirements, especially for those with less impact on the overall user experience for everyone else.

Understanding the scope of different terms helps to better understand their relationships:

* **Accessibility** - addresses discriminatory aspects related to equivalent user experience for people with disabilities, including people with age-related impairments. For the Web, accessibility means that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites and tools, and that they can contribute equally without barriers. Further background is provided in the introduction to web accessibility.

* **Usability** - is about designing products to be effective, efficient, and satisfying for the target audience of the product. In essence this would include user experience for people with disabilities but does not fully address the technical aspects of accessibility. Moreover, usability guidance and tools often neglect accessibility considerations.

* **Inclusion** - is concerned with ensuring access for everyone, and that nobody is left behind. This includes broad aspects such as language and cultural diversity, connectivity (to electricity and the internet), computer skills and literacy, and affordability of hardware and software, as well as access for people with disabilities.

## Accessible Design

Accessibility is an essential part of inclusive web design. It is supported by a comprehensive set of [guidelines, standards, and techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/guid-tech.html), as well as educational resources. These considerations can be combined with other design considerations, such as for [internationalization](https://www.w3.org/International/), to ensure an accessible and inclusive Web.

Yet accessibility is more than technical standards. In reality both technical standards and input from real people are important. Combining accessibility and usability expertise ensures that web design is technically and functionally usable by people with disabilities.

### Usable Accessibility

For web designers and developers, a key aspect of usability is following a user-centered design (UCD) process to create positive user experiences. <abbr>UCD</abbr> focuses on usability goals, user characteristics, environment, tasks, and workflow in designing user interfaces to meet user requirements. For example, <abbr>UCD</abbr> considers users' hardware, software, computer experience, task knowledge, and other characteristics in designing a website or service. <abbr>UCD</abbr> is an iterative process with well-defined methods and techniques for analysis, design, and evaluation from the first stage of projects through implementation. The needs of people with disabilities can be incorporated throughout <abbr>UCD</abbr> and other usability techniques, to implement accessibility requirements effectively.

### Real People

The goal of web accessibility is to make the Web work well for people, specifically people with disabilities. While technical standards are an essential tool for meeting that goal, marking off a checklist is not the end goal. People with disabilities effectively interacting with and contributing to the Web is the end goal.

To make the Web work well for people with disabilities, all those involved in creating websites need to understand the basics of [how people with disabilities use the Web](/WAI/intro/people-use-web). Following <abbr>UCD</abbr> recommends that [people with disabilities are involved](/WAI/users/involving) throughout the design process, ideally early in the design process, and [in web accessibility evaluations](/WAI/eval/users). This approach helps to design solutions that are effective for users with disabilities and provides additional benefits to all other users.

### Technical Standards

While including users with disabilities is key to making accessibility efforts more effective and more efficient, that alone cannot address all issues. Even large projects cannot cover the diversity of disabilities, adaptive strategies, and assistive technologies. Adhering to accessibility [guidelines, standards, and techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/guid-tech.html) is an essential part of the design process, even though it is not the end goal.
