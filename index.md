<h1>Accessibility, Usability, and Inclusion: <br>
  Related Aspects of a Web for All </h1>
<div>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p><em>Accessibility, usability, and inclusive design</em> are closely related. Their goals, approaches, and guidelines overlap significantly.</p>
  <p>In most situations, such as when designing and developing websites and applications, it is most effective to address them together through a holistic approach that  leads to a   more accessible, usable, and inclusive web for everyone.</p>
  <p>There are a few situations when it's important to  focus specifically on one aspect, such as when addressing discrimination against people with disabilities and when defining specific accessibility standards.</p>

    <dt><strong>Accessibility</strong></dt>
    <dd><em>Accessibility</em> addresses discriminatory aspects   related to equivalent user experience for people with disabilities,   including people with age-related impairments. For the web,   accessibility means that people with disabilities can perceive,   understand, navigate, and interact with websites and tools, and that   they can contribute equally without barriers.

    <dd><em>Usability</em> is about designing products to be   effective, efficient, and satisfying.

  <h3>Accessibility and Usability</h3>
  <p>While accessibility focuses on people with disabilities, many accessibility requirements also improve usability for everyone. Accessibility especially benefits people without disabilities who are in limiting situations, such as [@@ using the web on a mobile phone when your eyes are busy (such as driving), in bright sunlight, in a dark room, when your hands are full, in a quiet environment (where you don't want it to make noise), in a noisy environment (where you can't hear well), and in an emergency (when you may not be thinking clearly)]. Accessibility includes both:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Requirements that are more specific to people with disabilities</strong>; for example, they ensure that websites work well with assistive technologies such as screen readers that read aloud web pages, screen magnifiers that enlarge web pages, and voice recognition software that is used to input text. Most of these requirements are technical and relate to the underlying code rather than to the visual appearance.</li>
    <li><strong>Requirements that are also general usability principles</strong>, which are included in accessibility requirements because they can be significant barriers to people with disabilities. For example, a website that is developed so that it can be used without a mouse is good usability; and use without a mouse is an accessibility requirement because people with some physical and visual disabilities cannot use a mouse at all. In defining accessibility requirements, [@@ care is usually taken to not include aspects that impact all people fairly similarly, and only include aspects that put person with a disability is at a disadvantage relative to a person without a disability].</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Usability and user experience design significantly overlap with accessibility <em><strong>when</strong></em> &quot;specified users&quot; includes people with a range of disabilities and &quot;specified context of use&quot; includes accessibility considerations such as assistive technologies. However, the needs of people with disabilities are often not sufficiently addressed in usability practice and research. Additionally, accessibility includes a technical aspect that is usually not a focus of usability. Some basic accessibility is a prerequisite for usability.</p>
  <p>[@@ encourage usability folks to include accessibility - here or later?]</p>
  <h3>Accessibility and Inclusive Design</h3>
  <p>Several accessibility requirements also benefit people and situations that are a focus of inclusive design. For example, <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/soc#groups">Web Accessibility Benefits People With and <em>Without</em> Disabilities</a> describes accessibility benefits to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>people with low literacy or not fluent in the language</li>
    <li>people with low bandwidth connections or using older technologies</li>
    <li>new and infrequent users</li>
    <li>mobile  users</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, accessibility focuses on disability and does not try to  address broader issues. Other efforts, such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/">internationalization</a>, address  other inclusion issues.</p>
  <p>While people with disabilities are generally included in the scope of inclusive design, it is important to also maintain  a <strong>specific focus on people with disabilities through accessibility</strong> so that their needs are not diluted or overshadowed in the broader scope of inclusion. [@@ check wording in W4A paper - &quot;Keeping accessibility focused on disabilities  encourages research and development on meeting the specific needs of people  with disabilities.&quot; ...]</p>
  <h2 id="inclusive-design">Accessible Design</h2>
  <p>The goal of web accessibility is to make the web work well for <strong>people</strong> with disabilities. Accessible design has both a technical component and a user interface component.</p>
  <p>There are <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/guid-tech.html">guidelines, standards, and techniques</a>, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag">WCAG</a>), which is the international standard <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/2012/10/wcag-20-is-now-also-isoiec-405/">ISO/IEC 40500</a>. If designers, developers, and project managers approach accessibility as a checklist of meeting accessibility standards, the  focus is only on the  technical aspects of accessibility, and the human interaction aspect is often lost.</p>
  <p>Combining accessibility standards and usability processes with real people ensures that web design is   technically and functionally usable by people with disabilities. This is referred to as <em>usable accessibility</em> or <em>accessible user experience (UX)</em>.</p>
  <h3 id="usable-accessibility">Usable Accessibility</h3>
  <p>Web designers and developers can use usability processes, methods, and techniques, such as user-centered design (UCD) process and user experience design, to address the user interface component of accessibility. While the considerations of people with disabilities are not always included in common practices, they can be easily integrated into  existing usability processes, methods, and techniques.</p>
  <p>A key aspects is incorporating <strong>real people</strong> in design, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensuring that everyone   involved in web projects  understands the basics of <a href="http://w3c.github.io/WAI/intro/people-use-web">how people with disabilities use the Web</a>,</li>
    <li> <a href="http://w3c.github.io/WAI/users/involving">Involving users with disabilities</a> early and throughout the design process, and </li>
    <li> <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/users.html">Involving users in evaluating web accessibility</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p id="technical-standards"><strong>Accessibility standards</strong> also have an important role in accessible design. Usability processes and user involvement alone   cannot address all accessibility issues. Even large projects cannot cover the   diversity of disabilities, adaptive strategies, and assistive   technologies. Accessibility <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/guid-tech.html">guidelines, standards, and techniques</a> ensure that the wide range of issues are adequately covered.</p>
  <p>Additionally, understanding  the basic <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/principles">Accessibility Principles</a> and using the guidelines for developing early prototypes helps the development team provide basic accessibility so that when users do evaluations, they are able to use the prototype enough to provide useful feedback. <em>[@@ is that too specific for this doc?]</em></p>

<h2 class="no-display">Introduction</h2>

*Accessibility, usability, and inclusion* are closely related and overlap significantly. They are most effectively addressed together, such as when designing and developing websites and applications. While practitioners should understand that each aspect may have somewhat different requirements and standards, a holistic approach leads to a more accessible, usable, and inclusive web for everyone.

## Inclusive Design

In some regions this is referred to as *universal design* or *design for all*. It involves designing products, such as websites, to allow their use by the broadest audience possible. This includes people with different needs and preferences, which may be due to disability or other circumstance. For example, one person may need text size larger or smaller than another, or may prefer a specific font type over another. Fortunately the Web is designed to be adaptable so that it can meet these different needs, for example through web browser and website preference settings.

Accessibility addresses many aspects of inclusive design on the Web, which is why it is sometimes considered to be a synonym. However, accessibility alone does not address all aspects of inclusive web design, such as for language support and mobile design. Also, such a broad focus would likely overshadow specific accessibility requirements, especially for those with less impact on the overall user experience for everyone else.

Understanding the scope of different terms helps to better understand their relationships:

* **Accessibility** - addresses discriminatory aspects related to equivalent user experience for people with disabilities, including people with age-related impairments. For the Web, accessibility means that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites and tools, and that they can contribute equally without barriers. Further background is provided in the introduction to web accessibility.

* **Usability** - is about designing products to be effective, efficient, and satisfying for the target audience of the product. In essence this would include user experience for people with disabilities but does not fully address the technical aspects of accessibility. Moreover, usability guidance and tools often neglect accessibility considerations.

* **Inclusion** - is concerned with ensuring access for everyone, and that nobody is left behind. This includes broad aspects such as language and cultural diversity, connectivity (to electricity and the internet), computer skills and literacy, and affordability of hardware and software, as well as access for people with disabilities.

## Accessible Design

Accessibility is an essential part of inclusive web design. It is supported by a comprehensive set of [guidelines, standards, and techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/guid-tech.html), as well as educational resources. These considerations can be combined with other design considerations, such as for [internationalization](https://www.w3.org/International/), to ensure an accessible and inclusive Web.

Yet accessibility is more than technical standards. In reality both technical standards and input from real people are important. Combining accessibility and usability expertise ensures that web design is technically and functionally usable by people with disabilities.

### Usable Accessibility

For web designers and developers, a key aspect of usability is following a user-centered design (UCD) process to create positive user experiences. <abbr>UCD</abbr> focuses on usability goals, user characteristics, environment, tasks, and workflow in designing user interfaces to meet user requirements. For example, <abbr>UCD</abbr> considers users' hardware, software, computer experience, task knowledge, and other characteristics in designing a website or service. <abbr>UCD</abbr> is an iterative process with well-defined methods and techniques for analysis, design, and evaluation from the first stage of projects through implementation. The needs of people with disabilities can be incorporated throughout <abbr>UCD</abbr> and other usability techniques, to implement accessibility requirements effectively.

### Real People

The goal of web accessibility is to make the Web work well for people, specifically people with disabilities. While technical standards are an essential tool for meeting that goal, marking off a checklist is not the end goal. People with disabilities effectively interacting with and contributing to the Web is the end goal.

To make the Web work well for people with disabilities, all those involved in creating websites need to understand the basics of [how people with disabilities use the Web](/WAI/intro/people-use-web). Following <abbr>UCD</abbr> recommends that [people with disabilities are involved](/WAI/users/involving) throughout the design process, ideally early in the design process, and [in web accessibility evaluations](/WAI/eval/users). This approach helps to design solutions that are effective for users with disabilities and provides additional benefits to all other users.

### Technical Standards

While including users with disabilities is key to making accessibility efforts more effective and more efficient, that alone cannot address all issues. Even large projects cannot cover the diversity of disabilities, adaptive strategies, and assistive technologies. Adhering to accessibility [guidelines, standards, and techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/guid-tech.html) is an essential part of the design process, even though it is not the end goal.
