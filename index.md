## Introduction

*Accessibility, usability, and inclusion* are closely related and overlap significantly. There are a few cases when it is important to distinguish between these terms, such as when defining specific requirements and standards. However, they are more effectively addressed together, such as when designing and developing websites and applications. A holistic approach, with understanding for the different requirements and standards, leads to a more accessible, usable, and inclusive web for everyone.

## The Context

There are no absolute boundaries for the terms accessibility, usability, and inclusion because they are qualitative aspects. There are several definitions for each. Rather than attempting yet another definition, the following describes the scope of these terms.

### Accessibility

Accessibility addresses discriminatory aspects related to equivalent user experience for people with disabilities, including people with age-related impairments. For the Web, accessibility means that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites and tools, and that they can contribute equally without barriers. Further background is provided in the [introduction to web accessibility](/standards/webdesign/accessibility).

While accessibility features typically improve the use and experience for many more people, accessibility is not about the inclusion of everyone. Such a broad focus would likely overshadow specific accessibility requirements, especially for those with less impact on the overall user experience for everyone else.

### Usability

Usability is about designing products to be effective, efficient, and satisfying for the target audience of the product. In essence this would include user experience for people with disabilities but usability guidance and tools often neglect accessibility considerations. Usability provides techniques and approaches, such as user-centered design (UCD), that can be used to implement design considerations, including accessibility considerations, more effectively.

In general, usability does not fully address the technical aspects of accessibility. Combining usability techniques with accessibility considerations effectively addresses user experience and technical requirements for people with disabilities. Involving people with disabilities in usability processes ensures usability of accessibility features (usable accessibility) and an improved user experience for everyone.

### Inclusion

Inclusion is concerned with ensuring access for everyone, and that nobody is left behind. This includes broad aspects such as connectivity (to electricity and the internet), computer skills and literacy, language support, and affordability of hardware and software, as well as access for people with disabilities. Many of these aspects are inter-related and need to be analyzed and addressed concurrently. For example, older people often observe functional impairments that might be combined with lower digital literacy. Addressing only one of these aspects does not ensure inclusion for everyone.

#### Inclusive Design

In some regions this is referred to as *universal design* or *design for all*. It involves designing products, such as websites, to allow their use by the broadest audience possible. This includes people with different needs and preferences, which may be due to disability or other circumstance. For example, one person may need text size larger or smaller than another, or may prefer a specific font type over another. Fortunately the Web is designed to be adaptable so that it can meet these different needs, for example through web browser and website preference settings.

Accessibility addresses many aspects of inclusive design on the Web, which is why it is sometimes considered to be a synonym. However, accessibility alone does not address all aspects of inclusive web design, such as for language support and mobile design.

## Accessible Design

Accessibility provides an essential foundation for inclusive web design. It is supported by a comprehensive set of [guidelines, standards, and techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/guid-tech.html), as well as educational resources and supporting materials. These can be combined with other design considerations, such as for [internationalization](https://www.w3.org/International/), to design for an accessible and inclusive Web.

Yet accessibility is more than technical standards. In reality both technical standards and input from real people are important when designing and developing for accessibility. Combining accessibility and usability expertise ensures that web design is technically and functionally usable by people with disabilities.

### Usable Accessibility

For web designers and developers, a key aspect of usability is following a user-centered design (UCD) process to create positive user experiences. <abbr>UCD</abbr> focuses on usability goals, user characteristics, environment, tasks, and workflow in designing a user interface to meet user requirements. For example, <abbr>UCD</abbr> considers users' hardware, software, computer experience, task knowledge, and other characteristics in designing a website or service. <abbr>UCD</abbr> is an iterative process with well-defined methods and techniques for analysis, design, and evaluation from the first stage of projects through implementation. The needs of people with disabilities can be incorporated throughout the process; for example:

* *Goal definition* - Goal definitions set the overall targets and priorities. Defining accessibility goals at this stage supports its consideration as an integral part of the website vision, functional description, and other requirements.

* *Persona development* - Personas are used to understand and communicate user needs in early stages of design. Including personas with disabilities ensures that accessibility requirements are considered from early on and througout.

* *Use Cases* - Use Cases explain how users engage with a website and how the system responds. Incorporating use cases for common tasks performed by users with disabilities ensures that key functionality is considered from early on, rather than to need retrofitting in later stages.

* *Prototyping* - Prototypes are used for undertaking design choices, including for accessibility. Accessibility barriers typically highlight usability issues for everyone else, and should be specifically analyzed during prototyping.

* *Usability testing* - Different techniques are used for usability testing throughout design and development. Including people with disabilities is essential to identify accessibility barriers and improves the findings overall.

* *Technical Standards* - While including users with disabilities is key to making accessibility efforts more effective and more efficient, that alone cannot address all issues. Even large projects cannot cover the diversity of disabilities, adaptive strategies, and assistive technologies.

### Real People

The goal of web accessibility is to make the Web work well for people, specifically people with disabilities. While technical standards are an essential tool for meeting that goal, marking off a checklist is not the end goal. People with disabilities effectively interacting with and contributing to the Web is the end goal.

To make the Web work well for people with disabilities, all those involved in creating websites need to understand the basics of [how people with disabilities use the Web](/WAI/intro/people-use-web). Following <abbr>UCD</abbr> recommends that [people with disabilities are involved](/WAI/users/involving) throughout the design process, ideally early in the design process, and [in web accessibility evaluations](/WAI/eval/users). This approach helps to design solutions that are effective for users with disabilities and provides additional benefits to all other users.

Usability efforts often focus on primary user groups and common user characteristics; in the past, many have not included people with disabilities. However, there are benefits to including people with disabilities in usability research and practice, including:

* *Broader design perspectives* - Involving people with disabilities early in design processes broadens designers' perspectives and can lead to making products work better for more people in more situations.

* *Easier identification of usability issues* - People with disabilities are often more sensitive to usability problems, making the problems much more apparent. For example, a large number of links poorly organized on a web page will be more of a problem for people with some types of cognitive, physical, or visual disabilities.
